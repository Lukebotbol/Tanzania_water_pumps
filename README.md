# waterpumps_tanzania
Descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analysis of a public dataset on water pumps in Tanzania.

This workbook, the contained ML models and the visualizations were created by me and three collaborators during a group work project for Programming for Business Analytics Module of MSc Business Analytics at University College London (UCL).
